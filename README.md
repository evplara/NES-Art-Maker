# NES Art Maker 

A small NES art program built using cc65, running on a simple NROM-256 ROM layout.
It includes a canvas you can draw on with multiple tools, a palette system with blue/green/red regions, and a random noise generator.

## Features:
  Cursor-based drawing system
  Tools: brush, eraser, line, rectangle, flood fill
  Multi-palette support (blue, green, red regions at same time)
  Random noise generator (A+B combo)
  Canvas + UI bar built with CHR tiles

## File sources  
nes.cfg straight from cc65 sample nes.cfg
crt0.s – startup code / iNES header, based on cc65 NES startup examples
